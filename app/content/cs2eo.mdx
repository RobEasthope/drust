The [cs2eo](https://cs2eo.com) app is Earthwave's high performance geospatial-temporal query platform for earth observation data. cs2eo enables users to discover, visualise and download the spatial and temporal intersections between ESA, NASA and other earth observation datasets.

I built both the first prototype and production versions of the React app rendering NASA and ESA satellite data onto to a globe using the Cesium mapping package.

Complex search functionality was used to forms and search polygons was created to allow scientists an easy, visual way to search for access and download multi-gigabyte sized datasets.

Under the hood redux-toolkit and complex query strings were used to tie the various forms together.
