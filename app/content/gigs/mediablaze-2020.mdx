import { InternalLink } from "@/components/_base/InternalLink/InternalLink";

- Worked on two sister projects; A
greenfield build of <InternalLink href="/mediablaze">MediaBlazeâ€™s</InternalLink> company portfolio and and an internal client-facing site for Amway.
- Both site were built with Gatsby.js and Storyblok CMS.
- Strongly typed in Typescript.
- Each UI component was built into a Storybook component for testing and client preview with links to the Figma designs.
- The Amway site authentication was handled via serverless functions to ensure client privacy.
