import { InternalLink } from "@/components/_base/InternalLink/InternalLink";

- Architected, designed, and built the front end of the <InternalLink href="/civic-space">
  Civic Space</InternalLink> prototype web app.
- Worked closely with a small team of developers, I integrated satellite imagery and data visualisation elements into a user-friendly interface, that met the specific needs of civil society organisations while balancing development time constraints.
- The core of the app utilised React, Remix, and Mapbox technologies to enhance the application's functionality.
- One of the key focuses during the development process was data and API security. The team took extensive measures to ensure that user data was protected at all times. To avoid vendor lock-in and ensure data security, we made use of open source libraries and self-hosted solutions.
