Civic Space is a project that aims to provide satellite imagery and data visualisation tools for civil society organisations. The project is designed to help organisations monitor and analyse human rights violations, environmental degradation, and other issues that affect communities around the world.

The project is built using React, Remix, and Mapbox. It is hosted on independently controlled servers to ensure data privacy and security. The project is designed to be accessible and user-friendly, and to provide a valuable resource for organisations working to promote social justice and human rights.
