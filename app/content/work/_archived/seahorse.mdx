Seahorse is a prototype advertising brochure web app for national marketing campaigns via the The Telegraph site.

Built using React with Redux integration in preparation for later CMS integration, Seahorse makes extensive use of page transitions animations and progressive asset loading to create a smooth user experience similar to a paper magazine.
