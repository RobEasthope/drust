Mediablaze is a next-gen site built with Gatsby.js with the content served from a headless Storyblok CMS.

The site uses a component based architecture, allowing users to create complex, customised pages at will. Users can drag and drop components around the page without the need for developer support

Coded in TypeScript to create a solid, developer friendly codebase, each component was modelled in Storybook to give designers and content creators a preview of each component.
