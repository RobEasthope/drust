Delhaize is a European food retail group with 6,500 stores in eleven countries. Over the last few years they have been steadily building up their e-commerce business across Europe.

This Place has been designing and building modular, static front end code which is then handed off to Delhaize's in house developers for integration into a SAP based website. Each of these modules is rigorously tested and is styled for each of Delhaize's multiple European brands and languages.

I was brought into help with the front end development as Delhaize ramped up their 2018/19 development plans.
