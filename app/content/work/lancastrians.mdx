The Association of Lancastrians in London is a venerable social group bringing together residents of the [Duchy of Lancaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Lancaster) from across the Greater London area.

The Association site was designed as a fully responsive WordPress site built using Bootstrap 2. It is used to give an alternative way for members to view the quarterly association newsletter, while giving information on upcoming events, and ways for members to share memories.

The Associations switch to digital required a higher quality logo so I designed a brand new logo using historically accurate heraldic elements.

Years later this crest is still in use and was recently used in print magazine, Country Life.
