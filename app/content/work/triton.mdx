Triton is a boilerplate template code combining Next.js, Remix, Storybook, and Sanity Studio apps in a monorepo project structure.

The accompanying UI component library are designed to be framework agnostic with a healthy DX experience.

Designed to be deployed to Vercel, tooling is handled by TurboRepo to create blazingly fast builds.

Triton has been used as the jumping off point for the Free Flight Academy, Ohealio, Aalto, and Portfolio project amongst others.
