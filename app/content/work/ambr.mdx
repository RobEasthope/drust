Ambr media was a short lived media start up company I helped found, specialising in websites, PR and graphic design work.

Ambr was seeded with money from The Prince's Trust and served clients in the charity, NGO and finance sectors.

Following a successful initial launch, Ambr embarked on a full redesign of its logo and branding. This initial work experimented with hand painted watercolour swatches overlaid with super-sized typography.
