TrailLink is part of the US Rails-To-Trails Conservancy which is opening up unused American railway lines to create a network of trails across the United States.

Pixeled Eggs was given a brief to design a brand new responsive website for TrailLink and build a modular static version of the website to be handed off to a backend development company.

Designed from the start around atomic design principles each section of the site was built to be a independent module that could reused across the entire site.

To assist this aim and ensure a speedy and smooth development, the site was built with Jade (Now renamed to Pug.js) to allow rapid templating.
