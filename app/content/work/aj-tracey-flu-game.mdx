Flu Game: The Game is a promotional campaign for AJ Tracey's album 'Flu Game', which itself is a basketball reference to a famous match where Michael Jordan played with the flu and still helped his team win.

The game get fans shooting virtual hoops over 16 levels, with various characters (and a jumping pizza) trying to get in the way. Tracey pops up with encouragement, and players can listen to the album's official playlist while playing.

I worked on the game and overall site UI components, game logic, and audio prompts while other developers handled the gameplay elements using WebGL and Canvas APIs.
