The OVO Energy Dashboard is a data visualisation dashboard for the COP 2023 conference. The dashboard is designed to show the energy consumption of the UK, and to provide insights into how the UK can reduce its carbon footprint during the energy transition.

The dashboard is built using React and the Recharts charting library to create bespoke charts for each visualisation. Fully responsive and accessible it aimed to provide a user-friendly experience for conference attendees.
