The Haygarth project was a full stack redesign of Haygarth's company portfolio and blog. The brief was to build a fully responsive site which showcased Haygarth's creative work.

I built the majority of the front end elements as the rest of the development team and striped out the old Drupal based CMS replaced with a bespoke Laravel CMS based around simplicity and ease of use.

<Gallery
  images={[
    { image: landingAsset, alt: "Haygarth landing page" },
    { image: spriteAsset, alt: "Haygarth project example page" },
  ]}
  columns={1}
  className="mt-2"
/>
