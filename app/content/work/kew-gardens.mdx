Kew Gardens launched it's upgraded and redesigned website in 2019 after nearly two years of work. The design was updated in-house while the development and Drupal 8 upgrade was handled by Manifesto.

I worked on the project in the closing weeks helping the front end team with the final features and bug fixes in the run up to the April launch.
