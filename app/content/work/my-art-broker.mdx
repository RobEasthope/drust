MyArtBroker is the worlds only private sale network dedicated to blue-chip Prints & editions. It uses it's extensive databases and private network to allows it's brokers to source and sell almost any authenticated edition of urban and contemporary art.

I was brought in to work on their state of the art Next.js and Sanity site fixing post-launch bugs, improve build times, and add extra functionality.
