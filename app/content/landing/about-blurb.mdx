I'm a senior front end developer based in the UK. specialising in
building (and occasionally designing) digital experiences for the web.

With over twelve years of industry experience, I have worked for some of
London's leading agencies, consulted for start ups, and worked with over <OrgCount /> clients and agencies including the United Nations, NASA, and global
multi-nationals.

Outside of work I can usually by found on the fells, paragliding,
trail running, or scrambling. I recently returned from a month in Nepal where I
summitted <ExternalLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokalde">Pokalde</ExternalLink>, <ExternalLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imja_Tse">Island Peak</ExternalLink>, <ExternalLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobuche">
